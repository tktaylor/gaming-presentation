    <h1>Short Introduciton</h1>
    <p>Gaming has been a hobby of mine since I was a very small child.  My interest in it has only grown over the years.</p>
    <p>I started out with console gaming and have owned a variety of consoles.  A few years after that, still in my childhood, I had started playing computer games for the Mac.  Later on, I switched to Windows/PC, which is currently my primary source of gaming now.</p>

    <h1>PC Games versus Console Games</h1>
    <p>As I said, I'm primarily play games on the computer, so I tend to focus on those types.</p>
    <p>Computer hardware in the past 30+ years has rapidly increased in its capabilities in displaying graphics for video games.  We've gone from Pong to life-life graphics.</p>
    <p>The benefit I find with playing games on a PC over a console is that a PC's components can be changed and upgraded.  Not to mention, typically the components in a PC are usually more powerful than what a console can provide, because console manufacturers are trying to make a quality product within a certain price-point.</p>
    <p>However, that also means that building a PC is typically more expensive than buying a console, assuming that you already have a TV.  The computer I built about a year and a half ago costed around 1800 dollars, but I did buy some premium parts so that the machine would last me a couple more years outside of its life cycle.  It's not uncommon for PC gamers to have to replace parts of their computer, or the entire computer every three to five years because of the ever increasing demand of requirements from games; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law" target="_blank">Moore's law</a> is not in our favor.</p>
    <p>Another boon for console games is that some console manufacturers or video game developers will create games that are exclusive to a console.  This is particularly true in the case of Nintendo.  Unlike some game developer who will release their product to consoles and computers, others are released to one specific console, or to all of the big three (Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Xbox One, Sony Playstation 4).  Nintendo's Switch is the only console in recent years that has made me want to buy their console because it offers unique games set in some of their main franchises, specifically Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey.</p>
