    <h1>Short Introduction</h1>
    <p>Gaming has been a hobby of mine since I was a very small child.  My interest in it has only grown over the years.</p>
    <p>I started out with console gaming and have owned a variety of consoles.  A few years after that, still in my childhood, I had started playing computer games for the Mac.  Later on, I switched to Windows/PC, which is currently my primary source of gaming now.</p>

  <div class="third-slide slide">

    <h1>PC Games versus Console Games</h1>
    <p>As I said, I'm primarily play games on the computer, so I tend to focus on those types.</p>
    <p>Computer hardware in the past 30+ years has rapidly increased in its capabilities in displaying graphics for video games.  We've gone from Pong to life-life graphics.</p>
    <p>The benefit I find with playing games on a PC over a console is that a PC's components can be changed and upgraded.  Not to mention, typically the components in a PC are usually more powerful than what a console can provide, because console manufacturers are trying to make a quality product within a certain price-point.</p>
    <p>However, that also means that building a PC is typically more expensive than buying a console, assuming that you already have a TV.  The computer I built about a year and a half ago costed around 1800 dollars, but I did buy some premium parts so that the machine would last me a couple more years outside of its life cycle.  It's not uncommon for PC gamers to have to replace parts of their computer, or the entire computer every three to five years because of the ever increasing demand of requirements from games; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law" target="_blank">Moore's law</a> is not in our favor.</p>
    <p>Another boon for console games is that some console manufacturers or video game developers will create games that are exclusive to a console.  This is particularly true in the case of Nintendo.  Unlike some game developer who will release their product to consoles and computers, others are released to one specific console, or to all of the big three (Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Xbox One, Sony Playstation 4).  Nintendo's Switch is the only console in recent years that has made me want to buy their console because it offers unique games set in some of their main franchises, specifically Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey.</p>

    <h1>The Effect of the Internet on Video Games</h1>
    <p>As the internet began to grow in the '90s, video games started to branch out into this unknown territory by including multiplayer aspects.  Previously, video games would offer multiplayer in a way that required a second person to physically be in the same area as the first player.  With the internet, people could play video games together from all over the world - if there was a way to connect to the other player.  I grew up playing Warcraft 2 on a Mac, finding other players in the America Online Warcraft League.</p>
    <p>As the internet became mainstream, the ability to play games with other players online became easier.  Blizzard Entertainment released a gaming service called Battle.net which made the experience for finding players nearly painless.  Logging into Battle.net for a game, there was a chatroom, and several ways to either create a game lobby (for other players to join) or join a game lobby that another player has created.  In most cases, it still required a player to "host" the game, which required a strong enough internet connection, a powerful enough computer, and the correct ports forwarded so people could join, so it was not perfect.</p>
    <p>Other games allowed players to set up their own servers, where other players could join and leave as they pleased.  A player would access the multiplayer section from the game's main menu and had the option of viewing a list of servers that they could join.  The earliest game I know of that did this is Battlefield 1942, but it was probably used in games before that.  However, this functionality is still used in games today, a common example is Minecraft.</p>
    <p>In recent times, playing multiplayer games are easier through the use of online services like Steam.  A game company can integrate their authentication with Steam's API, and players can seamlessly join games with other players.  Not all games are like this though, but that's a story for another time.</p>
    <p>A final point I wish to make is about the Steam service.  Steam has enabled gamers to purchase and play video games without leaving their desk.  Video game developers launch their game on Steam's store, players purchase the game through Steam's store, and then download the game onto their computer and play to their heart's content.  This requires the player to have a fast enough internet connection, though.  Most urban areas, this isn't a problem as high-speed internet is near-ubiquitous.  No more game boxes taking up room because it's all hosted through the cloud.</p>
