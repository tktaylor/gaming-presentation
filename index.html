    <h1>Short Introduciton</h1>
    <p>Gaming has been a hobby of mine since I was a very small child.  My interest in it has only grown over the years.</p>
    <p>I started out with console gaming and have owned a variety of consoles.  A few years after that, still in my childhood, I had started playing computer games for the Mac.  Later on, I switched to Windows/PC, which is currently my primary source of gaming now.</p>

          <li>Different styles of board games
            <ul>
              <li>Competitive - any game that has you playing against one or more players
                <ul>
                  <li>Monopoly</li>
                  <li>Risk</li>

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Cooperative - one or more players team up to complete some objective or goal to "win" the game, essentially playing against the game itself
                <ul>
                  <li>Pandemic</li>
                  <li>Arkham Horror</li>
                  <li>Betrayal at House on the Hill</li>
                  <li>Spirit Island</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I find cooperative board games to be more fun, but there are few mainsteam games in this style.</p>
